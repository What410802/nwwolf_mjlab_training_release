"""HIM runner configuration for blackW.

Uses the validated N-W-wolf MjLab HIM algorithm but the blackW-specific HIM
interface: actor history group ``actor`` (6 x 57), estimator velocity group, and
the 16 joint/wheel actions.  Encoder/actor shapes are the official blackW HIM
shapes, which makes an official TorchScript policy usable for warm start.
